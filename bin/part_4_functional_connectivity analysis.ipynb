    "# Functional Connectivity Analysis\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have an idea of three important components to analyzing neuroimaging data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data manipulation\n",
    "2. Cleaning and confound regression\n",
    "3. Parcellation and signal extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook the goal is to integrate these 3 basic components and perform a full analysis of group data using **Seed-based Functional Connectivity (FC)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seed-based functional connectivity is essentially a result of performing correlational analysis on signals extracted from an ROI with other parcels. Using this technique we can establish highly correlative regions in resting state data which form **functional networks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis forms a basis for many other sophisticated techniques in neuroimaging research. "
